# Design Tokens Structure

Design tokens repository consists of three tiers of JSON files:

## Base Tokens
Base Tokens contain the foundational values for our design system, such as colors, typography, and spacing.

## Theme Tokens
Theme Tokens reference the Base Tokens and define the specific styles for each theme in our system, such as light, dark, or high contrast.

## Component Tokens
Component Tokens reference the Theme Tokens and define the styles for each individual UI component in our system, such as buttons, forms, and cards.

By organizing design tokens into these tiers, It can maintain consistency across entire design system and easily make updates as needed. This repository is essential for any designer or developer working within a design system.
